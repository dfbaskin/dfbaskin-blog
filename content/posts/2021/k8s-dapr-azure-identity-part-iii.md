This post will step through setting up user authentication using Azure Active Directory.

The source related to this post is contained in the [`adding-authentication`](https://github.com/dfbaskin/azure-and-dapr-identity-example/tree/adding-authentication) branch of the repo.

## Creating an AAD Application

We will need to regiser an application with Azure Active Directory. The following are links to comprehensive documentation about this process.

- [Microsoft Identity Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview) - this is an overview of services that Microsoft provides for managing user identity.

- [SPA Web Site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-spa-overview) - our application is a [SPA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) implementation. It will use the [OAuth 2.0 Authorization code flow (with PKCE)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) to authenticate a user and call web APIs.

- [Registering a Web Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-spa-app-registration) - instructions for creating a web application which uses MSAL.js 2.0 or greater.

- [On-Behalf-Of Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow) - this describes how API calls can be made by a web server on behalf of an authenticated user.

Specifically, to configure the example application:

- Update the `packages/browser-frontend/src/services/ConfigService.ts` file to include the client id and [authority](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-client-application-configuration#authority) used for authentication.

```
export function fetchAuthConfig(): Promise<AuthConfig> {
  return Promise.resolve({
    clientId: "f7edc002-e261-42e5-9140-8dde2e83260c",
    authority:
      "https://login.microsoftonline.com/fa1ee923-839f-4da5-a453-6eefaf3c9699/",
  });
```

- Update the "Single page application" redirect URLs to point to the `testing.local` domain we've configured on the `/auth-callback` path.

- Ensure that the Microsoft Graph `User.Read` API permission is enabled.

## User Authentication

We use the [Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js#readme) within the front end application. This is part of Microsoftâ€™s Identity Platform and has the tools for authenticating the user and requesting access tokens.

The additional code within this example application wraps the MSAL authentication library into a state machine, powered by [XState](https://xstate.js.org/docs/), as well as a [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) that wraps the state machine and allows UI components to access the machine. However, the authentication flow itself is handled by the MSAL library (found in `packages/browser-frontend/src/services/AuthService.ts`).

A client-side route `/auth-callback` is used to allow the MSAL library to handle the redirects from the authentication service and then redirect back to the main page.

## Testing Authentication and the Microsoft Graph API

Once you've configured the application, you can start it (in "dev" mode) using `npm start`. Navigate to `https://testing.local:3000/` and sign into the application.

The application can also call the "Me" method from the [Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview). The following function retreives the access token for the `User.Read` scope and passes it on to the "Me" endpoint.

```
export function fetchMeFromBrowser() {
  return getUserDetails()
    .then((details) => {
      if (!details.isAuthenticated) {
        throw new Error("User is not signed in.");
      }
      const { bearerToken } = details;
      return fetch("https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me", {
        method: "get",
        headers: new Headers({
          Authorization: `Bearer ${bearerToken}`,
        }),
      });
    })
    .then((rsp) => {
      if (!rsp.ok) {
        throw new Error(`Request was not successful (HTTP: ${rsp.status})`);
      }
      return rsp.json();
    });
}
```

We can also update the container image for the web application to use within the Kubernetes cluster by running the build and initialization scripts again:

```
packages/browser-frontend/deploy/build-frontend-image.ps1
packages/browser-frontend/deploy/initialize-frontend.ps1
```

Then navigate to the Kubernetes ingress endpoint, [https://testing.local:31001/](https://testing.local:31001/).

Next up, we'll create a back end web API for the front end application to use, including verifying the identity of the user and making a request to the Microsoft Graph API on behalf of the user.
