## Building a Web Front End and Ingress

The first step is to build a simple web application and then create a path for a client (a web browser) to access this application. The source for this post is from the [`building-frontend-app`](https://github.com/dfbaskin/azure-and-dapr-identity-example/tree/building-frontend-app) branch in the repo.

Iâ€™m using [React](https://reactjs.org/), starting with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) using the [Typescript template](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript). I am also using [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) to provide routes for navigation within the application.

Because I want to use access the application using `https://`, I've added additional configuration to the `packages/browser-frontend/.env` file that incorporates the certificates that were created previously.

```
BROWSER=none
HTTPS=true
SSL_CRT_FILE=../../certs/testing-local.crt
SSL_KEY_FILE=../../certs/testing-local.key
```

Doing so, allows me to run the web application locally (using `npm start`) at the address:

[`https://testing.local:3000/`](https://testing.local:3000/)

If the certificate was not set up correctly, the browser will complain about it being invalid or uknown.

## Building the Front End Container Image

The next step is to build a container image (using Docker) that will be deployed to the Kubernetes cluster. Running the command:

```
npm run build
```

builds the React application into a set of static set of files (including `index.html`, JavaScript, CSS, and other files). These files need to be served to the client (a browser). A popular mechanism is to use the open-source [NGINX](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/) package.

The `packages/browser-frontend/Dockerfile` describes the container using a pre-existing NGINX image where the web application build files as well as a `nginx.conf` configuration file are copied into it.

```
FROM nginx:latest
COPY ./deploy/frontend-nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
COPY ./build/ /var/www/site/
```

In the web application, there are two routes, one to the root (`/`) and one to an "About" page (`/about`). When serving content for a SPA web site, the server needs to recognize that the About page really comes from the default `index.html` content. There is no content to load if the user refreshes the page on the `/about` route. So the `packages/browser-frontend/deploy/frontend-nginx.conf` handles sending the correct content.

```
http {
  include mime.types;
  sendfile on;
  server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    root /var/www/site;
    index index.html index.htm;
    location ~* \.(?:manifest|appcache|html?|xml|json)$ {
      expires -1;
    }
    location ~* \.(?:css|js)$ {
      try_files $uri =404;
      expires 1y;
      access_log off;
      add_header Cache-Control "public";
    }
    location ~ ^.+\..+$ {
      try_files $uri =404;
    }
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
  }
}
```

The following script can be used to build the static web site and the container image:

`packages/browser-frontend/deploy/build-frontend-image.ps1`

To incorporate this image into Kubernetes, the following configuration is used to define a [deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) and a [service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: frontend-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: frontend-webserver:v1.3
          imagePullPolicy: Never
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: frontend
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

The deployment describes the state of the [pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) including the image that was built as described above. The service then exposes the deployment as a network service.

The following scripts can be used to initialize these components:

- `packages/nginx-ingress/create-namespace.ps1` - creates a separate [namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) in which to install the example application. This makes deleting the entire application from Kubernetes easier.

- `packages/browser-frontend/deploy/initialize-frontend.ps1` - applies the configuration for the front end application using the image that was built previously.

We can now verify that the front end application is running with a few commands:

```
> kubectl get deployment -n azure-dapr-identity-example

NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
frontend-deployment   1/1     1            1           62s

> kubectl get service -n azure-dapr-identity-example

NAME               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
frontend-service   ClusterIP   10.103.234.151   <none>        80/TCP    81s

> kubectl get pod -n azure-dapr-identity-example

NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
frontend-deployment-68dbc6f5dd-2qj82   1/1     Running   0          4m5s

> kubectl port-forward service/frontend-service 32001:http -n azure-dapr-identity-example

Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:32001 -> 80
Forwarding from [::1]:32001 -> 80
```

The last command temporarily forwards requests from your local machine on port 32001 to the `http` port (port 80) of the `frontend-service` (press `Ctrl`+`C` to stop it). Navigate in a browser to [http://localhost:32001/](http://localhost:32001/) and you should see the web application.

(The application doesn't do anything interesting, yet.)

## The NGINX Ingress Controller

An [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) allows the outside world to interact with services within the Kubernetes cluster. The [IngressClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#ingress-class) defines configuration for a particular type of ingress including the type of [Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) that implements the class.

In our example, we are using the [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/overview/) for Kubernetes.

> _Note that this ingress controller is different from the [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) maintained by the Kubernetes team. The differences are documented [here](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/blob/master/docs/nginx-ingress-controllers.md)._

The simplest way to use this ingress controller is using a [Helm](https://helm.sh/) chart. We customize the chart with some annotations:

```
controller:
  name: example-app-ingress
  healthStatus: true
  defaultTLS:
    cert: $CERT_VALUE
    key: $KEY_VALUE
  service:
    httpPort:
      port: 31002
      targetPort: 80
    httpsPort:
      port: 31001
      targetPort: 443
```

And use the following script

```
packages/nginx-ingress/initialize-nginx-ingress.ps1
```

to update `$CERT_VALUE` and `$KEY_VALUE` properties with a base-64 encoded version of the certificate and private keys we created previously and then apply the chart to the Kubernetes cluster.

Finally, we create use the Ingress definition to map requests coming into the Ingress Controller to the front end application:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: frontend-ingress
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - testing.local
      secretName: example-app-ingress-nginx-ingress-default-server-tls
  rules:
    - host: testing.local
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: frontend-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

The `frontend-service` exposes the static web site within the Kubernetes cluster and the ingress defintion routes calls that match the `testing.local` domain and matching paths. In our case we are just sending all incoming requests to `frontend-service`. We'll be adding a Web API that will be another destination for routed traffic.

This definition will also configure [TLS-termination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_termination_proxy) for us. An incoming request from outside the cluster will be encrypted, but within the cluster the requests can flow to the service unencrypted (over the `http` protocol). Note that once we incorporate DAPR, this changes, however, which we will discuss later.

This ingress definition can be applied using the command:

```
kubectl apply -f frontend-ingress.yaml -n azure-dapr-identity-example
```

Once this is all configured, you can navigate in the browser to the application at [https://testing.local:31001/](https://testing.local:31001/).
