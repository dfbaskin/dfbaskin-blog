What Javascript Framework should you be using? This seems to be the question everybody is asking ...
and everybody seems to have a different answer. I'm here at ng-conf 2015. Is AngularJS the answer?

Angular has a particular opinion about how to build a Javascript application. But other popular alternatives
exist. [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/ "Ember.js") prescribes a set of conventions that help build
large-scale web applications. [React and Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html) provide
composable view components that can be assembled together to build a solution. And it seems like a new
Javascript framework is released every few minutes that touts some amazing new feature (which, of course,
has led to [Framework Fatigue](http://www.allenpike.com/2015/javascript-framework-fatigue/)).

At ng-conf, however, a thought occurred to me. We saw presentations that discussed topics like:

- how the Angular team discusses plans for Angular 2.0 and the existing 1.x versions in public, open forums
  with lots of input from the community.

- how the Angular team didn't have the right tool to measure performance, so they built their own benchmark tool
  and showed actual numbers for performance improvements.

- how the Angular team, having already built unit testing (Karma) and end-to-end (Protractor) testing tools,
  wanted to also include accessibility testing, to ensure all users of various abilities could use the web
  applications that Google and others are building.

- how the Angular team not only has thousands of tests around the source code that are automatically run in
  a continuous integration environment, but that when they push out releases of Angular, they also run tests for
  many of the internal Google applications built on Angular to ensure that changes haven't broken functionality.

- how the Angular team works with other members of our diverse community, like the TypeScript team or the Ember
  team, to see where there are opportunities to work together.

Consider how much care and craftsmanship is going into Angular as an open-source project. Perhaps there are
other projects that operate at this level, but it's probably the exception not the rule.

No one is saying that AngularJS is the right answer to every problem. But if I am an organization trying to
make a decision on what Javascript framework I should use, how could I ask for more diligence from a project
that I will use as a cornerstone to build my own application? I don't think you can go wrong with choosing
Angular and its popularity is rightly justified.
